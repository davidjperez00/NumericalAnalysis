This repository proposes three different approaches to predicting vehicle prices for the
[Vehicles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho). Preprocessing techniques can be viewed in the `util.py ` file.

The three approaches that were taken are:
* Polynomial Regression model with 1 feature
* Polynomial Regression model with all features
* Neural Network incorporating all dataset features
